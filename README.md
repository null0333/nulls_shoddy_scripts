# nulls_shitty_scripts
shitty scripts that dont deserve their own repo

### pzip
archive large files by breaking them into chunks, b64 encoding the chunks and then putting them on pastebin
maybe useful for piracy ? free filehosting lol
also supports password protected pastes, i might add burn after read its not too much effort

### fuckoff.hpp
simple loonix anti debug, do not use this without using some sort of anti-patch
this is part of my bigger project udf2s which is a remote attestation protocol for malware

### chartgen
chart generator for soundcloud, pretty self explanatory
